# David Caffrey Portfolio Site

Stream One Project: User-Centric Frontend Developement - Code Institute

This is a portfolio site to showcase my current and future projects. This site is for potential employers and freelance clients to view, so that they may see 
the technologies I have used and my design process. Included is a bio section, a downloadable version of my CV, a contact page and a page of projects.

## Demo
A live demo of my portfolio site can be found [here](https://DavidCaffrey.github.io/David-Caffrey-Portfolio-Site/)

## UX
My primary focus for the project was to create a mobile reponsive site that would not require the end user to do too much navigation. 
I wanted the site to allow all users to view my previous work, my skills, info about me, and find my github page.
For future employers I wanted to provide them with a downloadable version of my CV.

### User stories

From an employers perspective I want to see a body of completed projects.

From a clients perspective I want to see functional visually pleasing sites.

From a recruiters perspective I want see a CV.

###  Strategy

My goal in the design of this site was to provide a mobile first, user friendly, visually appealing experience for the end users.

### Structure 

In the project/portfolio section the end user will be able to quickly get and overview of the types of projects I have completed. These technologies will be broken down 
into diiferent sections. Each project will have a link to live site and to the relevant Github page.
The about me page will contain a little bio infomation.
The contact page will enable the end user to get in contact via email, phone or social media accounts.

### Surface 

A modern look and feel through the use of soft pastel colors. Just a few animations to the cards(bootstrap) I used to add a little movement to the site without being 
overpowering visually.


## Technologies

* HTML
* CSS
* BOOTSTRAP 4
* JAVASCRIPT


## Features 
The sites main focus being a crisp design, I used cards to provide me with the compartmentalization I desired. During the build I felt that the cards could do with 
something to make them standout and opted to give them a little animation.

#### Features left to implement
I will add more projects as they become available.
