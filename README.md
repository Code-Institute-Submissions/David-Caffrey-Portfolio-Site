# David Caffrey Portfolio Site

Stream One Project: User-Centric Frontend Developement - Code Institute

This is a portfolio site to showcase my current and future projects. This site is for potential employers and freelance clients to view, so that they may see 
the technologies I have used and my design process. Included is a bio section, a downloadable version of my CV, a contact page and a page of projects.

## Demo

## UX

### User stories

From an employers perspective I want to see a body of completed projects.

From a clients perspective I want to see functional visually pleasing sites.

From a recruiters perspective I want see a CV.

###  Strategy

My goal in the design of this site was to provide a mobile first, user friendly, visually appealing experience for the end users.

### Structure 

In the project/portfolio section the end user will be able to quickly get and overview of the types of projects I have completed. These technologies will be broken down 
into diiferent sections. Each project will have a link to live site and to the relevant Github page.
The about me page will contain a little bio infomation.
The contact page will enable the end user to get in contact via email, phone or social media accounts.
